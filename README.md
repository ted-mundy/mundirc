# mundIRC

As of writing this, I'm in a cabin somewhere in East Yorkshire, where the internet struggles to load any sort of static website - *and that's not including Javascript or images.* To waste time and also try to counter this situation, instead of downloading an exsiting IRC client/server I've decided to make my own. Hopefully this gets used at least once, but if not, it's something cool for my profile.

Written in golang, both server and client. As the server is extremely lightweight/literally something to waste time, it won't connect to an external database, or write anything to disk. For now.
